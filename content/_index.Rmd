#### Analytics and dashboards

We build state-of-the-art analytical pipeline, from the database to the product. Our main expertises includes data wrangling, survey analysis, textual analysis, social network analysis, clustering and modeling. We bring them together to write analytical reports and studies to get a better knowledge of your business or your organization subject.

What is even more important than the algorithms and technical methods used is the way you can get the knowledge from the datas. We build custom dashboard, static or dynamic, to bring you the best insights and help and your organization take the right decision.

#### Designed and parametrized reports

Your organization often need PDF reports. Sometimes hundreds, one for each business zone or administrative area, with custom parameters ? With new datas each month ? 

We can build such reports for you, with a lot of possibles options. And because the design is as important as the content, we implement your organization graphical rules in it or create a custom one for you.

#### Process automation

Data analysis is a matter of repetition. You need the same report each month ? You are asked to update the dashboard ? You have to make a new 200 hundred pages publication which will be reproduce each year with a lot of people involved ? Send a mail with key insight each day ?

Call us and we will automate your process. Give us the parameters and you will get the result. Because all our processes are reproducible, we ensure quality and avoid errors due to copy-pasting.
