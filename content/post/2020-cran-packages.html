<p>For all R users, CRAN is the place were you can find most of the packages you need to run code. Last month, I saw this Xkcd drawing :</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png" /></p>
<p>And this remind me of something : behind packages, you can find people. And this people are at the heart of all your analytics pipelines because they build, maintain and develop R packages. It’s their ideas and their work, discussion and collaborations that made R as it is. One example of it is the <a href="http://adolfoalvarez.cl/plumbers-chains-and-famous-painters-the-history-of-the-pipe-operator-in-r/">fantastic story of the pipe</a> (<code>%&gt;%</code>) by Adolfo Alvarez.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a bit about this people and their packages !</p>
<div id="which-packages-are-we-talking-about" class="section level2">
<h2>Which packages are we talking about ?</h2>
<p>Not all packages on CRAN are equal. They are all useful and all needed a big bunch of work. But some are more useful than others, also because they are more general.</p>
<p>I try to appreciate it by comparing two things :</p>
<ul>
<li>how much the package has been downloaded ?</li>
<li>how many packages use the package as a dependency ?</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first one, I used <code>{cranlogs}</code>, a package which show the download statistics for the RStudio CRAN mirror, from 2013 to now. It’s not all the CRAN downloads but it’s a nice part of them. We choose to compute the median download by month for each package, since it’s first appearance (so for months with more than 0 download). I did so since we got some strange stats for packages like <code>{tidyverse}</code> with an incredible amount of downloads in november 2018 or a big amount of downloads for <code>{aws.s3}</code> over the last year that I couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>For the dependency count, I used some centrality measures from graph network theory. What is important to me is to know how much times the package is listed as a dependency (so in-degree centrality), how many dependency it has (out-degree centrality) and if the package is “important” in the global network of the dependency graph. For this last measure, I used PageRank centrality, the same algorithm as Google.</p>
<p>With all of that, we get the following table with all the packages on CRAN :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>add centrality</strong></li>
<li><strong>tab form</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I gathered the main infos in a graph, crossing centrality (in-degree) and popularity (downloads). I annotate some main areas :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>on the right of the graph, a lot of packages, very popular like <code>{dplyr}</code> or <code>{ggplot2}</code> (the whole <code>{tidyverse}</code> collection in fact) or <code>{httr}</code>. This packages are direct downloads from the people. They are widely-used. A lot of packages depends of them.</p></li>
<li><p>on the top-left, some more unknown packages to neophytes like <code>{ellipsis}</code>, <code>{vctrs}</code>, <code>{pillar}</code>, etc. This packages have a lot of downloads but are only listed as a dependency by a few but very important packages. In fact they are more “infrastructure” packages. They are the foundations of some more-used packages and they hide the more low-level functions. So we can guess that the downloads are not direct downloads but come from the download of other packages.</p></li>
<li><p>some other packages, in the middle between the two above categories, like <code>{rlang}</code> or <code>{Rcpp}</code> could be the most important R packages. We should also notice that they have a 0 out-degree centrality, so they depends on zero other package (they are root packages).</p></li>
</ul>
